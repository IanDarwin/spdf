= SPDF -- simple PDF API (incomplete)

A very trivial (so far) PDF generator API.

This API allows you to create simple PDF documents containing text.

As of now, the TODO list is probably longer than the features list.

This was first created in 2000 as a quick demo as part of the Java Cookbook 'javasrc' repository;
some of the git history still refers to other files that were committed at the same time.

I have more recently decided to pull it out and make it its own repo, and make it
a usable free library for generating PDF.

I invite you to help me move this forward by sending pull requests that add functionality.

But if not, feel free to use it as-is, if it meets your needs.
